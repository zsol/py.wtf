## Wat dis?

[It's](https://py.wtf) autogenerated reference docs for [PyPI](https://pypi.org)
packages. See for yourself at [py.wtf](https://py.wtf).

## Butwhy

[py.wtf](https://py.wtf) aims to be an absolutely 0 effort reference doc hosting site
for all packages on [PyPI](https://pypi.org): No setting up doc building pipelines,
domains, hosting providers.

- [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org) is very nice, but it has a
  [tutorial](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/). [py.wtf](https://py.wtf)
  just exists.
  - It's still _very_ nice for putting together more than just reference docs.
- [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/) is very nice, but it has a
  [tutorial](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/). [py.wtf](https://py.wtf) just
  exists.
  - It's still _very_ nice because you can write your docs in markdown and the output is
    pretty.
- [Pycco](https://pycco-docs.github.io/pycco/) is nice and its
  [tutorial](https://pycco-docs.github.io/pycco/) is pretty short too! But
  [py.wtf](https://py.wtf) just exists.

[py.wtf](https://py.wtf) statically (i.e. without installation) analyzes Python projects
to extract modules, functions, classes, variables, their types, and docstrings. Then
cross-references these across projects to display them in a single, integrated, and
searchable web page.

As such, it is impossible for project authors to configure [py.wtf](https://py.wtf),
apart from changing docstrings themselves. This brutal inflexibility allows
[py.wtf](https://py.wtf) to stay relatively simple[^1], and attempt to do one thing,
well.

[^1]:
    except for the parts that deal with
    [reStructuredText](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) and
    [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
